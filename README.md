# Unit 19 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.


## Acceptance Criteria
